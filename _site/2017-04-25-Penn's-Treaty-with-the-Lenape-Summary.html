      <h2 id="the-legend-of-penns-treaty-with-the-lenape">The Legend of Penn’s Treaty with the Lenape</h2>

<p>Penn’s treaty with the Lenni Lenape is a traditional American tale about the founding of Pennsylvania. As the tale goes, in 1682, under the great elm of Shackamaxon, Penn promised to live with the natives in “openness and love” and as “one flesh and one blood” to which Tamanend replied, “We will live in love with William Penn and his children, while the sun, moon, and stars endure.” Within one generation, Penn’s own sons cheated the Lenni-Lenape out of thousands of miles of land, but the legend continued to grow, popularized by paintings such as Benjamin West’s <em>William Penn’s Treaty with the Indians</em>. Today, the treaty is remembered as a symbol of peace and love.</p>

<p>Some scholars question the factuality of the treaty, as the legend grew largely out of West’s representation 90 years later. The agreement was not a written treaty, though there is evidence to suggest its existence. A Wampum belt depicting two men holding hands suggests a formal treaty between the Lenape and Penn. Now at the Philadelphia History Museum, it was supposedly given to William Penn at the time of the treaty. Andrew Newman writes that though Native Americans did not record in alphabetical writing the same way Europeans did, there is nothing inherently better or worse in the two systems. Furthermore, agreements of peace were often invoked by 18th century Native Americans, though it would suggest that Penn made a series of treaties, contrary to the “Great Treaty” tradition. Early English historians mention treaties of friendships made between Penn and the Natives, and Voltaire famously refers to the treaties between Penn and Native Americans as the only ones that have never been broken. While the treaty tradition may not be accurate, formal treaties of peace and friendship were likely exchanged between Penn and the Lenni Lenape.</p>

<p>While this peace and friendship is what is most commonly remembered in American history, the brief era of goodwill actually ended within a generation. Known as the Walking Purchase of 1737, William Penn’s sons John and Thomas and land agent James Logan claimed to have a sale deed from 1686 for the land north of Wrightstown that a man could walk in a day and a half. Apart from the suspected forgery of the deed, the Penns and Logan also hired three trained men to run a path cleared by settlers. One man ran sixty-five miles, giving a total of 1,200 square miles, far more than the Lenape agreed to. The treaty of goodwill stood at almost 50 years before the pattern of European displacement of Natives continued. The Lenape migrated further and further west for over a hundred years, the majority eventually settling in Oklahoma. Today about 20,000 Lenape live in Oklahoma, with smaller numbers of Lenape people in southern Ontario, Wisconsin, and Delaware.</p>

  <li>Wampum Belt</li>
</ul>

<p>“The Wampum Belt is the physical manifestation of the Penn Treaty, and exemplifies the exchange of promises that William Penn and the Lenape people made.  Supposedly two of the belts were created: one was given to Penn, and the other was kept by the Lenape.  Depicted on the belt are Penn and Chief Tamanend holding hands to represent the amiability of the treaty.  However, it is said that in 1782, Chief Killbuck lost the belt while fleeing European settlers.  This symbolizes how the Treaty was not kept on Penn’s end, as the Lenape today are no longer located in the Delaware region.”</p>

  <li>Piece of Original Tree</li>
</ul>

<p>“The Penn Treaty Elm, locally known as the Great Elm, represents the physical location where the Treaty was made.  Although many revere the Great Elm as a place where an important friendship was created, the significance of elm trees is folklore and mythology suggests otherwise for the Lenape people and other Native-Americans who have come in contact with European settlers.  In British and Scottish mythology, the elm has connections with the Underworld.  The signing of the Treaty under the Great Elm could then be read as the Lenape tribe’s demise, as William Penn’s descendants failed to honor the Treaty, and the Lenape were displaced from their home.”</p>

  <li>Painting of Penn Treaty Signing</li>
</ul>

<p>“Finished in 1771-72, <em>The Treaty of Penn with the Indians</em> by Benjamin West is one of the first examples of the treaty in an artistic/visual representation. It is from this painting that many of the other artistic interpretations of the treaty were inspired by. The painting gained great fame and notoriety as well leading to its depiction being taken closer to fact than artistic representation. Thus, as time has progressed, the painting has come to not only represent the actual event of the treaty but also the treaty itself.”</p>

  <li>Obelisk in Penn Treaty Park</li>
</ul>

<p>“Erected in 1827 by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania to commemorate the site on which the Great Elm stood, the obelisk presents a modern physical representation of where the treaty possibly lies. On the sides of the monument, inscriptions read: ‘Treaty ground of William Penn, and the Indian Nations, 1682, Unbroken faith; William Penn, Born 1644, Died 1713; Pennsylvania, Founded, 1681, by Deeds of Peace; Placed by the Penn Society, A.D. 1827, to mark the site of the Great Elm Tree.’ While marking the place of the treaty, the obelisk acts a physical reminder of how the treaty not only resides within the minds of the people but also within the land it formerly governed.”</p>

  <li>John Hancock Life Insurance brochure</li>
</ul>

<p>“This brochure, produced by the John Hancock Life Insurance company and in the possession of the Penn Treaty Museum, highlights the mythical nature of the treaty. Within the public sphere, the treaty has come to imply a sense of trust and genuineness; however, businesses have used this to their advantage whether truthful or not. In this case, the image of the treaty imbues the company with a sense of dependability and reliability. However, firms, such as the Penn Treaty Insurance company, have tarnished the legacy of the treaty through illegal and fraudulent actions.”</p>
