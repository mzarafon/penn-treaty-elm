<p>Penn Treaty Park commemorates the site of William Penn’s 1682 meeting and short-lived peace agreement with Chief Tamanend of the Lenape tribe. This peace agreement was made under an enormous and Elm tree in the Lenni-Lenape site of Shackamaxon, which is now part of the North Philadelphia neighborhood of Fishtown. Despite the short period of time that the Penn family honored the treaty - in 1727 William Penn’s heirs began to sell both bought and stolen Lenape land, and in 1737 engaged in the infamous and fraudulent Walking Purchase - the treaty and the ideals it espoused live on in the Park and with its lovers.</p>

<p>According to long-time Fishtown resident and historian Kenneth Milano, residents of Fishtown have long been drawn to Philadelphia’s rich history, particularly history tied to the neighborhood. Even in the 1890s, the residents, local politicians, and park organizations wished to transform the dilapidated site of the once-great Elm and Treaty into a beautiful community park. Drawing upon the simple desire for more open, green, civic spaces in Philadelphia, in 1892, the City Council and the Fairmount Park Art Commission came together to establish Penn Treaty Park. On October 28, 1893, the park publicly opened on the 211th anniversary of the peace agreement. But by the 1960s, the park no longer appeared as beautiful as it once did. So in 1976, in commemoration of America’s bicentennial celebration, federal and state money was appropriated to beautify Penn Treaty Park. In 1982, in honor of the 300th anniversary of the initially peaceful founding of Pennsylvania, the park was again expanded. Throughout the twentieth century, key anniversaries pertaining to Philadelphia and American history have been celebrated with reenactments of the meeting where the Penn Treaty came into being. In 1987, the Park was rededicated and the large, serene sculpture of William Penn was erected in addition to the park expanding its area.</p>

<p>The park space has made gestures to include American Indians in its programming, as Shackamaxon was known as a symbolic meeting place for American Indians in the area long before colonization. In the 1980s, Native American people participated in Penn Treaty reenactments, and in 1982, The United American Indians of the Delaware Valley hosted a three-day powwow at the park. In 1989 Chief Jake Swamp of the Mohawk tribe symbolically planted a white pine tree, commemorating Chief Tamanend and the forgotten Native American concepts that helped shape the United States’ early formation. In 1991, Native artist Bob Haozous designed a sculpture depicting the image of Penn and Tamanend from the original wampum belt exchanged in 1682, which he juxtaposed with symbols of modernity and pollution. Even this gesture of Native representation in modern art and in the Park was met with resistance from locals, and so Haozous’ sculpture stands in a median in middle of the street bordering the park. Like the Native people pushed to the edge of the Penn Treaty narrative, it occupies a space just outside of Penn Treaty Park.</p>

<p>Today, the park is a lush, rolling green space in gentrifying space of Fishtown. The Friends of the Penn Treaty Park, founded in 2005, organize clean-ups and refurbishments and other groups use the park for organized events. The Friends of the Penn Treaty Park’s mission is to preserve and enhance the beauty and usefulness of historic Penn Treaty Park.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Artifacts</b></p>

<p>Statue of William Penn - Model or photograph</p>

<p>The Statue of William Penn sits at the front of the park. The foundation of the statue is a circular shape with half the statue consisting of plaques and the other half consisting of the foundation for the statue of Penn.  Penn is holding the Penn Treaty in both of his hands while overlooking the park.  Therefore, this puts great emphasis William Penn’s legacy, especially his involvement in the formation of the Penn Treaty.  While the merits of representation and mutual exchange of the treaty are certainly debatable, the statue of William Penn is certainly an important sightline for Penn Treaty Park.</p>

<p>Bob Haozous Sculpture - Model or photograph (from Milano’s book)</p>

<p>The Bob Haozous sculpture is one of the most contested pieces of art work associated with Penn Treaty Park. It is made of steel double plates that stand parallel with one another. The plates contain cut out shapes of clouds and airplanes and on one side there is also a depiction of an image from the Wampum belt given to William Penn during the Penn Treaty (p.151). Rather than being a structure that sufficiently honors the Lenape people, it stays in the background, literally sitting outside the park. The sculpture is often disregarded due to its aesthetic and  its failure to adequately represent the voices of the Lenape people.</p>

<p>Penn Treaty Monument - Model or photograph (from Milano’s book)</p>

<p>The Penn Treaty monument stands as a historical marker of the treaty that took place between the Lenni-Lenape people and William Penn. Originally, the obelisk was placed in the Northwest corner of the land where the Elm Tree once stood. It was then, to the dismay of Fishtown residents, moved again because of park renovation. It is “about five feet nine inches tall” (p. 136) and surrounded by an iron fence. Behind the obelisk there is a stone wall. The monument that exists today has an aluminum plaque which describes the Treaty’s goal of friendship. However, the changing location of the obelisk sparks discussion today over the authenticity of the treaty itself.</p>

<p>Penn Treaty Reenactment - Photographs (from Milano’s book and Connors’ collection)</p>

<p>This photo taken in 1932 depicts two children taking part in a reenactment of the Penn Treaty at Penn Treaty Park. The description of the photo reads “Members of the Omaha Troop of Stetson Center impersonating an Indian chief and a squaw with her papoose.” Reenactments of the treaty have taken place for decades at Penn Treaty Park. During Pennsylvania’s tercentenary celebration Native Americans dressed in full regalia joined costumed Fishtown community members for a reenactment with an authentic replica of the wampum belt. Another notable reenactment took place at the official rededication of Penn Treaty Park on November 1st, 1987.</p>

<p>Delaware Power Station - Photographs and/or rubble</p>

<p>Built in 1917, the Philadelphia Electric Company’s Delaware Power Station looms over Penn Treaty Park. The massive power plant covering 223,000-square-feet and 16 acres of property was in operation until 2004 when its final two turbines were shut off and has since remained abandoned. On August 10th, 2016 the plant was designated historic on the National Register of Historic Places and added to the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places two days later. The dilapidated building that is visibly weathered, rusting, and covered in graffiti stands in direct contrast to neighboring green space of Penn Treaty Park.</p>
