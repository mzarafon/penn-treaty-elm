      <p>A common thread in the histories of William Penn and the Penn Treaty is that his Quaker principles made his interaction with Native Americans different from those of previous settlers. The assumption in narratives of Penn, the establishment of the Pennsylvania colony, and especially the Penn Treaty is that Penn’s Quakerism made his dealings with the Lenni-Lenape exceptional. Although other colonies had “purchased land from the Indians on the spot,” this had only been a “matter of expediency rather than right, and rum and the threat of force were used as handy instruments in the bargaining” (Drake, 1944). There is no denying that Penn’s Quaker values informed his approach to negotiating and interacting with the Lenape; however, attributing the exceptionalism of the Penn Treaty entirely to Penn’s values is overly-simplistic.</p>

<p>There are at least two other factors that also influenced Penn’s interactions with the Lenape that are often not accounted for in his legend: the effectiveness of other means and the Lenni-Lenape willingness to negotiate. First, Drake’s history claims that “violence was the rule…by which white men and red strove to drive each other from the land.” Although he accepts that early Pennsylvania settlers were “too few in number and weak in military power to threaten the Indians in their ample hunting grounds,” he attributes the negotiation of peace to the later settlers’ Quaker religion (Drake, 1944). Knowing that previous colonists had been in conflict with Native Americans would have also discouraged Penn from attempting a land grab against a well-established group.</p>

<p>Second, in Penn’s 1638 account of the Lenni-Lenape he describes the ceremony where they conducted all of their negotiations, including land treaties. Penn’s description challenges the idea that the Penn Treaty is an exceptional event that resulted from Penn’s benevolent Quaker ideals because it was a typical way of conducting business and because he was in a subservient role during the ceremony. In Penn’s description of typical negotiations, the “King” did not speak to Penn, but instead sent one of his advisors to speak “in the Name of his King” (Penn, Myers; 1937). Penn was astounded by the “natural sagacity, considering them without the help…of Tradition” and any man would “deserve the Name of Wise, that Outwit[ed] them in any Treaty about a thing they [understood]” (Penn, Myers; 1937). Though Penn’s religion added unique aspects to his approach to relations with the Lenape, the Penn Treaty was equally shaped by the existing political structures of the Lenape.</p>

<p>Penn’s legend has overshadowed the history of Pennsylvania’s founding because it has become the history of a great man instead of a nuanced history. Not only has this limited our understanding of Penn as a complex individual with a variety of motives, but it has also excluded the Lenni-Lenape from histories of Pennsylvania. Penn’s legend is then in front of his own history and the history of the Lenape people.</p>

<p><em>William Penn: Quaker Hero</em></p>

<p>One problem with William Penn’s legend as benevolent politician and settler is that it has given primacy to his role in shaping Quaker-Lenape relations. His foregrounding in historical narratives has portrayed the Lenni-Lenape as passive in the negotiations of the Penn Treaty. William Penn’s legend, and therefore his history, is thus located in front of the history of the Lenni-Lenape. This is visually represented by the illustration on the book’s cover. In the story, the name “Lenape” is never used.</p>

<p><em>Quaker Oats Can</em></p>

<p>Quaker Oats has capitalized on people’s perception of Penn as the ideal “quaker man” in order to sell their product. A Quaker Oats magazine from 1909 describes Penn as “the standard bearer of  the Quakers and Quaker Oats…to this day [they [can] look that honest Quaker, William Penn in the eye and say [they] have never sent a false, a misrepresented, a stale or a moldy package from [their] door”. In placing Penn on every Quaker Oats product, the company emphasizes the honest and quintessentially “Quaker” aspects of William Penn, placing his legacy at the forefront of Pennsylvania history.</p>

<p><em>Penn’s Description of the Lenni-Lenape</em></p>

<p>Upon first glance, it appears as though Penn’s account of the Lenni-Lenape expresses nothing but sincere praise. However, upon further analysis we see that Penn’s description of the Lenape is more of an attempt to placate Europeans’ fear of Native Americans. His descriptions are oversimplified, emphasizing that the people are simply “the most merry creatures that live, feast, and dance perpetually”. He similarly describes their features as different from the “thick lip and flat nose, [which is] so frequent with the East-Indians and Blacks…[instead he sees]… European faces among them”. His description reads more as a reassurance than a sincere account.</p>

<p><em>Print of “Penn’s Treaty with the Indians” by Benjamin West</em></p>

<p>This is the most traditional portrayal of William Penn and his interactions with the Lenape. According to <em>The History of Penn Treaty Park</em>, West’s painting was the world’s introduction to William Penn, the Penn Treaty, and the traditional narrative of the founding of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia. Penn is the subject of the painting, as indicated by his body language and the position of other people in the scene. The Lenape are standing behind Penn, and chief Tamanend is partially blocked from view by other Lenape. The Lenape are also not named in the painting’s title.</p>

<p><em>Photos of Haozous’ statue, Penn Treaty Park</em></p>

<p>There is no better visual metaphor for Penn’s overshadowing of native history than the placement of statues in Penn Treaty Park. At the entrance to the park exists a statue of William Penn majestically holding the Penn Treaty. On an island defined by Delaware Ave and Beach St exists Bob Haozous’ statue commemorating the Lenape wampum belt. The physical separation of this monument from the park is a perfect visual metaphor for both the removal of the Lenape from the original narrative of the Penn Treaty and the Lenape’s forced westward migration.</p>
