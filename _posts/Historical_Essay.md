  A common thread in the histories of William Penn and the Penn Treaty is that his Quaker principles made his interaction with Native Americans different from those of previous settlers. The assumption in narratives of Penn, the establishment of the Pennsylvania colony, and especially the Penn Treaty is that Penn’s Quakerism made his dealings with the Lenni-Lenape exceptional. Although other colonies had “purchased land from the Indians on the spot,” this had only been a “matter of expediency rather than right, and rum and the threat of force were used as handy instruments in the bargaining” (Drake, 1944). There is no denying that Penn’s Quaker values informed his approach to negotiating and interacting with the Lenape; however, attributing the exceptionalism of the Penn Treaty entirely to Penn’s values is overly-simplistic.
