_Cover_

This brief publication tells a fictitious story of the Penn Treaty in what appears to be Quaker propaganda. At the beginning of the story, a beautiful Lenape woman is moved by Pennâ€™s religious preaching, while her peers are portrayed as greedily focusing on the European goods. This story follows in the footsteps of West and other white Americans, part of a long history of demonizing the Lenape in order to heighten the sense of Quaker benevolence and godliness in the myth of the Penn Treaty.
