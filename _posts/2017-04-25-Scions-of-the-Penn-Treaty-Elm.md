**Summary Statement** 

The Penn Treaty Elm is survived by its scions. But what are scions? Where are they? What do they represent? This exhibit aims to demonstrate how the scions document history.

**Historical Essay**

Scions of the legendary Penn Treaty Elm serve as a way to extend the lineage of the *Ulmus americanus* tree under which the alleged treaty of friendship between William Penn and Lenape Chief Tamanend took place in 1682 (“Penn Treaty Elm,” *Haverford College*). According to Merriam-Webster, a scion is “a detached living portion of a plant (as a bud or shoot) joined to a stock in grafting and usually supplying solely aerial parts to a graft.” One of the first scions was taken from the Elm by General Paul Oliver and replanted at his home. Other scions taken from the original elm have been planted at the University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania Hospital, the Westtown School and the Johnson Library in Camden, NJ.

In 1840, Haverford College was presented with a scion from Oliver’s tree. This “grandchild” was planted on Founders Green. In 1915, seven scions were taken from it and planted on Barclay Beach. Unfortunately, the original Founders Elm and six of the seven descendants succumbed to Dutch Elm Disease. The seventh tree (great-grandchild of the Penn Treaty Elm) still stands on Barclay Beach (“Penn Treaty Elm,” *Haverford College*). However, it is not alone. In 1977, seedlings from the deceased Founders Green Elm were planted in a nursery. Other scions from the original Founders Green Elm and its descendants have been placed at other sites, such as Ursinus College, Penn Treaty Park and the Lenni Lenape tribal grounds in NJ (“Penn Treaty Elm,” *Haverford College* & Newman). If not for these scions, the Penn Treaty Elm would only have lived on in artistic rendering.

As descendants of the Penn Treaty Elm, these scions serve many historical and metaphorical purposes. As there is no official documentation of the treaty, the elm itself has taken on the mantel of record. As long as the elm continues to be valued and celebrated, the logic remains that there must have been an event worth celebrating that is connected to the tree. In this way, the physical and living existence of the scions lends a sense of authenticity to the story of Penn’s treaty. The scions further function as living keepsakes or markers of historical events. As historian John Watson put it, the tree ought to be “preserved as a memento of the past [...] to link one generation with another,—to stand like living monuments speaking forth their solemn and soothing lessons, as from fathers to sons and the sons of sons” (Newman, 110). This notion that the trees themselves serve as monuments with specific historical lessons of which they are representative is a vital one. Some of these lessons remind us of the potential of peace, while others highlight a problematic history. For example, it is important to acknowledge the uncomfortable reality that a fourth-generation scion was gifted to the Lenni Lenape people even though the original Elm was located on land they once inhabited and considered sacred. In this way the scions serve as markers of historical lessons, as Watson suggests, and also as opportunities to question dominant historical narratives such as those surrounding the Penn Treaty.

**Artifacts**

*Scion, in the Bark* [physical potted scion]

This scion is a descendant of the Penn Treaty Elm’s great grandchild, located to this day behind Barclay Hall on Haverford College’s campus. With a circumference of 12 inches and standing over 7 feet tall, this scion is far from the gigantic proportions of its ancestor. We hope that one day this scion will reach and even surpass the 10 foot circumference and 90 foot height of the once great Penn Treaty Elm. Of course, by then it will no longer be indoors!

*Dutch Elm Disease at a Glance* [microscope that can be peered into; a slide of Dutch Elm Disease is mounted]

If you take a look inside our microscope you will see an example of the fungi that lead to the fall of the great Penn Treaty Elm: Dutch Elm Disease. If you look closely, you can see the fungal structures that are characteristic of Dutch Elm Disease. It is caused by a member of the sac fungi that affects elm trees and is spread by elm bark beetles. Dutch Elm Disease has claimed the lives of over 40 million American Elm Trees and continues to be a threatening tree disease (D’Arcy).

*Scion Science* [short video on how to harvest/plant a scion]

In this video, Haverford College Arboretum staff demonstrate the process of harvesting and grafting a scion. Although cuttings for the firsts scions of the Penn Treaty Elm were harvested over 200 years ago, the science remains the same. As expert caretakers of the descendents of the Penn Treaty Elm, the Arboretum staff work hard to maintain a viable supply of “grandchildren” in order to continue the legacy of the original Elm. Tree science is even something you can try at home - use the methods in this video to graft a tree in your own backyard.

*Where Are They Now?* [map of East Coast with locations of the scions marked]

The scions may all be descended from one tree, but now they grow in all sorts of different places. From Haverford College to Penn Treaty Park to the Lenape land in New Jersey, the scions stand as representatives of their ancestor and the treaty that took place in its shade. Which scion do you live closest to? 

The land on which the original Elm stood belonged to the Lenni Lenape people before any Quakers spotted its branches. Today the scions stand on land owned not by the Lenape people but by Pennsylvanians who once promised to share the land peacefully.

*Historical Letter and Photo of the Founders Green Elm*

This photograph of the Founders Green Elm, grandchild of the Penn Treaty Elm, was taken in 1949. A letter sent to the chairman of the Friends Historical Association on October 23, 1953 tells us that the tree trunk had a diameter of 50 inches and stood 4 feet 2 inches tall. Its spread of branches spanned approximately 100 feet. Unfortunately, it too succumbed to Dutch Elm Disease and had to be removed. You can see the similarities in structure between this elm and the elm that still stands on Barclay Beach. Notice Founders Great Hall in the background!
